# ⚙️ FIGHTING GAME LIME ⚡

**The Ultimate Steampunk vs. Cyberpunk Showdown**

---

## 🚂 Overview

**PISTON PUNCH: Chrono-Clash** strips the fighting genre down to its core: a brutal, high-stakes duel between two diametrically opposed worlds. In one corner, the gritty, steam-powered innovation of the past. In the other, the cold, digitized precision of the future.

This is a focused 1v1 fighting game experience featuring a deep, asymmetrical combat system and a thrilling clash of aesthetics.

## ⚔️ The Fighters: Two Worlds Collide

### 🛠️ Character 1: THE INGENIOUS (The Engineer)

* **Aesthetic:** **Steampunk/Brass Age.** Uses steam-powered gauntlets, retractable clockwork shields, and gear-based traps.
* **Playstyle:** **Heavy Zoner / Setup.** Relies on methodical movement, setting up pressure with deployable mechanical devices (turrets, springs), and powerful, slow-but-crushing strikes.
* **Key Mechanic:** **Pressure Maintenance.** The Ingenious's attacks build up **'Steam Pressure'** on the opponent, slowing their mobility temporarily.

### 🤖 Character 2: MECHANT (The Futurist)

* **Aesthetic:** **Cyberpunk/Neon Future.** Wields plasma blades, holographic projectors, and relies on bio-mechanical augmentation.
* **Playstyle:** **Rushdown / Mix-up.** Excels at lightning-fast dashes, aerial combos, and rapid-fire projectiles. Designed to overwhelm the opponent up close.
* **Key Mechanic:** **System Overload.** Neura-Mortis can spend a small amount of meter to perform a **'System Flicker,'** momentarily glitching to pass through projectiles or confusing the opponent's guard.

## ✨ Core Mechanics (Base System)

* **👊 Classic 2D Combat:** A deep, six-button foundation (3 Punches, 3 Kicks) for maximum combo creativity and strategic depth.
* **🔥 The Catalyst Gauge (Single Meter):** A shared resource that builds from dealing and receiving damage.
    * **Expenditure:** Used for character-specific utility moves (Steam Pressure or System Flicker).
    * **Ultimate Move:** When full, allows either fighter to unleash their cinematic **Overdrive**—a unique, high-damage attack reflecting their technological philosophy.
* **🔄 Asymmetrical Design:** Combat is designed around the stark contrast between the characters—slow, deliberate setups versus fast, invasive offense.
